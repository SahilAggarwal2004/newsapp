This project is made while following the react course of Code With Harry. But personally, I made some changes which are as follows:
a) I added a country option which shows the news of selected country, unlike the course project which was showin news of India only.
b) I added a search bar which searches for a particular term entered by the user inside the news.
c) For adding the horizontal loading bar at the top, Harry used a npm module but I wrote my own logic for that.
d) For infinite scroll till the news ends, Harry used another npm module but I wrote my own logic there also.

The points mentioned above justify that I create unique things from what I learn instead of copy pasting.

Don't forget to checkout more of my projects on github :)
